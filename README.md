- 👋 Hi, I’m Kishan K
- 👀 I’m interested in building reliable and high-performance applications using .NET technologies, exploring cloud solutions with Azure, and crafting APIs for seamless integrations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced concepts in .NET, such as MAUI for cross-platform development, gRPC for high-performance service communication, and utilizing Dapr for building distributed applications. Additionally, I’m diving into cloud-native development with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and exploring AI integration with ML.NET.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative .NET projects, open-source contributions, and solutions that solve real-world problems in the healthcare and enterprise domains.
